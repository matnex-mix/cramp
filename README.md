# Cramp - A php based simple file manager
Written in PHP, cramp uses crude and old methods to bring to life a fully functional but simple Web File manager though the crude steps would be updated later on.

### Usage
- Open `index.php`
- Set the CRAMP_BASE constant to your base location
- Hurray! You're ready to go.
